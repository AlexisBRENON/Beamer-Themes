# My Beamer's Themes

This repo will contains the beamer's theme that I will build. Maybe there will be only one that I will improve over time.  Let's go deeper :
* `BeamerTest.tex` is the sample file which I use to show the features of a theme. Maybe it will become bigger and bigger as features number increase;
* `makefile` is used to generate a PDF. It uses `xelatex`, you need to install it before proceed (perhaps it's included in the main tex package of your distribution). You can also customise it to choose the theme you want to use or whatever;
* `Output/` contains resulting PDF to show you some examples.
* `ab2015/` is my first theme. Heavily based on the default one and the [mtheme](https://github.com/matze/mtheme). It can be easily tuned for your need, see the `README` file in its folder.


**Please say me the problems you encounter (if any), I'll try to fix them !**

**Feel free to ask for some features !**
